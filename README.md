# Non-parametric-Classification
Different techniques, Class project (September 2021)

# Intro:
In recent years, the amount of data has been growing very rapidly which has
allowed various situations where different characteristics allow us
grouping data sets into subgroups with some degree of similarity, this is known as
classification. This technique is very important because it allows a better organization of the data, as well as
being able to identify possible strange cases that may indicate that something is wrong.

# Techniques used:
- Robust LDA
- Logistic regression with ridge kernell
- SVM with RBF and lineal kernells
- K-means and decision trees
